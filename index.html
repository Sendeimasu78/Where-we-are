[Chorus]  
If you're lost, where are you now?  
Ever since the day you went away  
And now I can't breathe  
Without you here  
That's how I know that you were always near  
It's like we never left  
It's like we never said goodbye  
We stayed right here  
And now I know just why  
You were always there  
Right by my side  
Right by my side...
